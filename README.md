# ansible-zabbix-agent
This is a complete ansible playbook for installing zabbix-agent2 on multible server with multiple distributions.
First task I creat as "create directory" for copy the deb/rpm to it, this is optional, because my situation was that my servers has no access to internet for download, so that force me to copy it localy.
